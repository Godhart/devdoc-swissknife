# Using as template and making own docs {#as_template}

To use this project as start point for your own documentation do following:

> You'll need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed

#. Import master branch of this repo:
[https://github.com/Godhart/devdoc-swissknife](https://github.com/Godhart/devdoc-swissknife)\
All the sources for docs are contained in `docs_src` folder.

#. Remove existing files named like `<number>-<words>.Rmd` from `docs_src` folder, but **keep** `index.Rmd`.

#. Empty `docs_src/diagrams` folder.

#. Replace following keywords
`<Author Name>`, `<author>`, `<repo>`, `<Document Title>`, `Document_Title`, `<Document Description>`
within files in `docs_src` with actual values.

#. Make docker image `devdoc-swissknife`.
Simply run `make_docker.sh` from `docker` dir.

#. Try to make docs with `make_docs.sh`.
Output docs should apear in `docs_out` folder.\
*Take a NOTE: this folder is ignored by git.*

#. Update `index.Rmd` to your needs (contains *Preface* section).

#. Add your own docs into `docs_src` dir, naming files like `<number>-<words>.Rmd`.\
Check the RMarkdown and Kroki! docs for understanding things, rely on shown examples.

#. Most probably you would like to use your own Latex book class, so add `<your_latex_book_class>.cls` file
 into `docs_src` and specify it in `index.Rmd` file (replace `documentclass: book` field).

> NOTE: in many cases of errors doc's sources folder is polluted with temporary files,
> named as specified in `_bookdown.yml` (field `book_filename`).\
> I can't fix this yet so avoid committing them.\
> After fixing the errors and making doc again those files would go away.\
