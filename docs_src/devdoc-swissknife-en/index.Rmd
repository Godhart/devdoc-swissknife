# Preface {-}

This is a demo project for development documentation generation with R Markdown and Kroki

This approach allows you to create reproducible documentation in form of PDF, presentations, gitbook
and some other HTML formats from simple markdown-like files (Pandoc flavor) with extra R chunks and textual diagrams description.

The goal of this project is to describe documentation via text files as much as possible, even graphic diagrams,
and make it easy to use without overcomplication.

A textual description provides an easy way to version and merge diagrams, get differences between versions, leave comments that
stays out from generated documentation, review changes, etc.

Also most often it's faster to create and **edit** diagrams as text, do things like theming and refactoring themes.
Since the diagram's textual description often is more a model than just graphics, you don't have to track existing objects
relations when just placement is changed or objects added (until you rename objects) which makes your workflow less error-prone.

R Markdown itself is a powerful and customizable tool, so you can fit docs to your needs. It would take efforts on start,
to make things neat but it would repay you in the end.

> To produce awesome PDFs you'll have to provide awesome Latex book class.
> Since I don't have one I'm using Latex default so current PDF version looks a bit ugly to me.
> I hope I can fix this soon or later. Help is appreciated!

This project is also can be used as a template for your own documentation, see [this section](#as_template)

The project uses docker and docker-compose to build docs so it's ready to be integrated into your CI/CD flow.

The project's structure, docs generation and some files are based on [R Markdown book](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book)

There are few demonstrations in the project for general development use-cases (which probably cover 95% of your daily needs).
For more complicated use-cases - checkout docs on links below.

> Diagrams code for most examples is borrowed straight from [Kroki](https://kroki.io/examples.html)
