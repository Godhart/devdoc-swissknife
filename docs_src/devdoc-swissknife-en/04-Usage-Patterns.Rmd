# Usage patterns {#usage}

There are few proposed ways to embed diagrams into a document and to customize them.

Which one to use depends on circumstances.

> This section would be updated as project evolves



## Embedding diagrams into a document {#usage-embed}

Let's cover basics on embedding diagrams into documentation first.

### Describing diagrams inline in the documentation {#usage-embed-inline}

Useful for short and/or strongly context-related drawings, i.e. when drawing by itself have no meaning
or there is no reason for storing it in a separate file.

Following pattern should be used:

````R
`r ''````{r <label>, dia='<engine>', fig.cap='<drawing name>'}
  to_diagram('<diagram data>')
```
````

where:

* `<label>` is a name for a drawing reference, may be omitted
* `<engine>` is a name for a rendering engine, see [table](#reference-engines) for allowed values and corresponding engines
* `<drawing name>` is a caption for drawing, may be omitted.
* `<diagram data>` is a textual diagram description in a format that is compatible with a rendering engine\
*NOTE: if there are single quotes in the `<diagram data>` then you should escape them with `\` symbol*
*or surround `<diagram data>` with double-quotes (`"`) instead.*



### Diagrams from raw outer files {#usage-embed-raw}

This is the case if you already have a diagram description in a separate file and you want to keep it like that for some reason.

> For new diagrams it's proposed to use method, described in the next section.
> It also uses outer files, but requires some extra formating.

Raw file is a text file that contains diagram description data in a format that is
compatible with a rendering engine and nothing more.

Following pattern should be used:

````R
`r ''````{r <label>, dia='<engine>', fig.cap='<drawing name>'}
  to_diagram(src='<src_file_path>')
```
````

where:

* `<label>` is a name for a drawing reference, may be omitted
* `<engine>` is a name for a rendering engine, see [table](#reference-engines) for allowed values and corresponding engines
* `<drawing name>` is a caption for drawing, mey be omitted
* `<src_file_path>` is a path to file with diagram data, relative to file into which it's embedded.\
*If you are using suggested locations to place docs and diagrams (`docs_src/doc-<subject>` and `docs_src/diagrams`)*
*then value for `<src_file_path>` should be starting like this: `../diagrams/`*



### Diagrams from Rmd outer file {#usage-embed-rmd}

This is a proposed way to describe diagrams in outer files. Diagram data should be in `.Rmd` file
and described as specified in `docs_src/diagrams/README.md` [TODO](TODO).

This way you'll be able to use [Keenwrite](https://github.com/DaveJarvis/keenwrite) to preview diagrams live
while editing, which is very handy.

Besides that, you can supply a diagram with additional info, capture decisions that were taken, add TODOs, versions info, etc.
along with diagram's data in the same file.

Following pattern should be used:

````R
`r ''````{r <label>, dia='from_src', fig.cap='<drawing name>'}
  to_diagram(src='<src_file_path>')
```
````

where:

* `<label>` is a name for a drawing reference, may be omitted
* `<drawing name>` is a caption for drawing, mey be omitted
* `<src_file_path>` is a path to file with diagram data, relative file into which it's embedded.\
*If you are using suggested locations to place docs and diagrams (`docs_src/doc-<subject>` and `docs_src/diagrams`)*
*then value for `<src_file_path>` should be starting like this: `../diagrams/`*

> Take a NOTE: A `from_src` is specified as engine in this case since an actual engine name is already specified in `.Rmd` file with diagram data.



### Get then embed {#usage-embed-getThenEmbed}

This is the case if you want to customize diagrams embedding, like aligning, multiple diagrams in a single row,
preprocess diagrams before embedding them, etc.

The process is divided into few phases:

#. Download one or multiple rendered images for your diagrams
#. Preprocess diagrams if required
#. Embed them into document

> NOTE: diagrams are still described in a text form

Following pattern should be used:

````R
# Download diagram
`r ''````{r dia='from_src'}
  to_diagram(src='<src_file_path>', downloadOnly=TRUE, downloadName='<file_name>')
```

# Download more diagrams if required (like the one above)
...

# Process diagram(s) if required
# Use code chunks for this (R, bash, python and many more with necessary commands)
...

# Embed diagram(s)
`r ''````{r <label>, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='<drawing name>'}
  knitr::include_graphics('generated/<file_name>.<file_ext>')
```
````

> NOTE: Example code is shown for outer Rmd file but there is additional
> `downloadOnly` and `downloadName` arguments are specified in the first code chunk.\
> Inline diagram description and raw outer file may be used aswell.

where:

* `<label>` is a name for a drawing reference, may be omitted
* `<drawing name>` is a caption for drawing, mey be omitted
* `<file_name>` is a name that is given to downloaded diagram
* `<file_ext>` is an extension is given depending on output format and [optional arguments](#usage-args-format).\
By default it's:
  * `.svg` for HTML output
  * `.pdf` for PDF output
  * `.png` for other kinds

> Take a NOTE: For postprocessing you can use R, Python, whatever can be called from BASH and many more
> (depends on your docker image).\

## HTML: SVG - Raw vs from File {#usage-svg}

By default diagrams are rendered as SVG for HTML output. This format is supported by all rendering engines in Kroki,
and produces great results for HTML.

But there is two ways how it's embedded into HTML. It's defined with additional `rawsvg` argument for [to_diagram](#usage-spec) function.


### Raw SVG {#usage-svg-raw}

By default SVG content is inserted as a code right into output HTML file and this is what `Raw` is.

Specify optional `rawsvg` argument as `TRUE` for [to_diagram](#usage-spec) function or just ommit it.

PROs:

  * Text in SVG becomes searchable and selectable.

CONs:

  * Diagrams aren't treated as images anymore and you can't use 'save as' by clicking on them.\
  *But in this case caption for the diagram will be a reference to an SVG file, so you are still able to save diagrams as files*
  * You'll have to find your way to post process it if necessary\
  *(It's still possible, but I can't offer 'ready to use' recipe yet, and as always there are few ways to do it)*
  * Lack of [customizations](#usage-rChunks) (only *width*, *height* and *alignment* available)\
  *(Probably it could be workarounded but no recipe yet)*

Since (IMO) strong customizations and postprocessing is hardly a case for common development docs,
RAW svg is used by default.


### SVG from file {#usage-svg-file}

Rendered SVG also can be inserted into HTML as a normal image.
It still looks neat when scaled, but now it's just a picture.

Specify optional `rawsvg` argument as `FALSE` for [to_diagram](#usage-spec) function.

This way you'll be able to apply more customizations and do postprocessing if necessary.



## Customizations {#usage-customize}

Sometimes you'll want to or need to specify a customizations like *width* or *hight* of diagrams
when defaults don't work fine or just because of your taste or requirements.
Also sometimes you'll have to use non-default *image format* for the same reasons.
Or you may want to go deeper with customizations and define *alignment*
and other things like *post processing*, *multiple images* in a row, etc.

> Probably you wouldn't want to use customizations at all when you in the beginning
> or in hurry to capture your ideas, but if you need some - start from here.

Most of customizations are specified via [**R chunk**](#usage-customize-rChunks) options.

In case if it's required to download rendered diagram in format other than SVG [use](#usage-format-renderer) `dformat`
argument for [to_diagram](#usage-spec) function.

Also for PDF production you'll want for sure things like page break, page orientation specification etc.
In this case you will need to add some [latex commands](#usage-latex) into document.


### R Chunks {#usage-customize-rChunks}

[**R Chunks**](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html) is a way to embed graphics data in **R Markdown**.

> Another way is to use markdown syntax like `![<alt text>](<path to image>){<options>}`,
> but it's not the case since it works for ready to use images only.

Customizations to the way an image is embded are speicifed via **R chunk** [options](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/r-code.html#figures).

More info about options could be found [here](https://yihui.org/knitr/options/)
and here is a nice [cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/rmarkdown-reference.pdf).

Following options have effect for diagrams:

* *out.width*
* *out.height*
* TODO

Following options have no effect for diagrams:

* *fig.width*
* *fig.height*
* TODO

The other way to customize is to use [hooks](https://yihui.org/knitr/hooks/).
It's very creative way and all depends on your needs.

Besides spcifying options explicitly for every chunk, you can define default values globally or via named templates,
use option hooks to automatically derive one options from another. See more about this in the following sections.


### Global options {#usage-customize-globalOpts}

This is done by putting chunk of code with `knitr::opts_chunk$set` function call
in the beginning of your documentation (i.e. `index.Rmd`).

Also global options could be redefined later in documentation for the following chunks.
For example this could be done in the beginning of every chapter.

> ATTENTION: But make sure in that case that you follow this pattern throughout whole document,
> otherwise you may find yourself fighting with customizations.\

Global options could be good for output format related customizations,
in other cases it's better to use templates, described in next section.

Example code to define chunk options globally:

````R
`r ''````{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  out.width = '5cm'
)
```
````

More info could be found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/chunk-options.html#chunk-options)


### Options templates {#usage-customize-templateOpts}

This is done by putting chunk of code with `knitr::opts_template$set` function call
in the beginning of your documentation (i.e. `index.Rmd`).

Also new templates could be defined later in documentation for the following chunks.
For example this could be done in the beginning of every chapter.

Example code to define options template:

````R
# Define template
`r ''````{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_template$set(fullwidth = list(
  out.width = '100%'
))
```

# Embed diagram, using template for options
`r ''````{r, dia='from_src', opts.label='fullwidth'}
to_diagram(src='...')
```

# More options for diagram and/or template's defaults override
`r ''````{r, dia='from_src', opts.label='fullwidth', fig.ext='png', out.width='10cm'}
to_diagram(src='...')
```
````

<!-- TODO: templates inheritance ? -->

More info could be found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/opts-template.html)


### Options hooks {#usage-customize-optionsHooks}

With options hooks you can define dependencies for chunk options with code in **R**.

You can even define hooks for your own options and specify this options for chunks.
For example hook for `dia` option is defined in `_fun.R` and some chunk's options depends on it.

This is done by putting chunk of code with `knitr::opts_hooks$set` function call
in the beginning of your documentation (i.e. `index.Rmd`).

Also new hooks cold be added or hooks could be redefined later in documentation for the following chunks.
For example this could be done in the beginning of every chapter.

Example code to add options hooks:

````R
`r ''````{r, include=FALSE}
# Define hook for existing option out.width
knitr::opts_hooks$set(out.width = function(options){
  # Some sanity checks
  if (!identical(options$out.width, NULL)) {
    # Our function: if out.width is set to 100% then clear out.height option
    if (options$out.width == "100%") {
      options$out.height <- NULL
    }
  }
  # Return new set of options
  options
})

# Define hook for new option fullwidth
knitr::opts_hooks$set(fullwidth = function(options){
  # Some sanity checks
  if (!identical(options$fullwidth, NULL)) {
    # Our function: if fullwidth is defined and evaluated as TRUE then set out.width to 100%
    if (fullwidth) {
      options$out.width <- "100%"
    }
  }
  # Return new set of options
  options
})
```

# Embed diagram, using new option to define width
`r ''````{r, dia='from_src', fullwidth=TRUE}
to_diagram(src='...')
```
````

### Multiple output formats {#usage-multipleFormats}

If you are intended to produce documentation in multiple output formats, most probably you'll have to apply different
customizations for different formats.

This could be easily achived by using **R** `if ... else ...` pattern (works like ternary operator) when applying values to options,
or with a few lines **R** code in complicated cases.

For example:

````R
`r ''````{r, dia='from_src', out.height=if (!knitr::is_html_output()) '15cm' else NULL}
to_diagram(src='...')
```
````

will set drawing's height to 15 centimeters for output formats other than HTML.


### Define parameters {#usage-customize-params}

There is a way to separate actual values for options from code via parameters, that are defined
in a front&#8209;matter part of `index.Rmd`.

This way you could tune your output or other aspects of your documentation
just by adjusting those values and keep them all in a single place.

> By the way - there is already some params defined that are reqruired for [to_diagram](#usage-spec) function and related hooks.

Values for parameters can be calculated just in time with **R** by defining their values using following pattern:
`` `r knitr::inline_expr("<R expressions>")` ``, replacing `<R expressions>` with your **R** code.

Parameters definition example:

```yaml
# This is front-matter's section to define params
params:
  # Static value:
  background: "#FFFFFF"
  # Calculated value:
  current_date: `r "\U0060"`r Sys.Date()`r "\U0060"`
  # Output format depended value:
  fig_ext: `r "\U0060"`r if (knitr::is_latex_output()) 'png' else null`r "\U0060"`
```

Parameters usage example:

````R
`r ''````{r, dia='from_src', fig.ext=params$fig_ext}
to_diagram(src='...')
```
````

More info can be found [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/parameterized-reports.html).

<!-- TODO: check https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49475303/rmarkdown-child-documents-do-not-detect-their-params -->


### Putting all together {#usage-customize-summary}

To avoid redundant work, and to ease refactoring and tuning following methodology is suggested to use from the start
to benefit from **R Markdown** features:

#. Declare subject specific parameters for your documentation

#. Define global options if necessary, use parameters to adjust options

#. Define all the necessary options templates for your diagrams embedding.
   You could use differnet templates for different output formats and specify their names via params,
   or you could define universal templates and tune them via params or
  use `if (knitr::is_<html/latex>_otput()) <value1> else <value2>` pattern.

#. Use options templates for diagrams code chunks, providing extra options if required



## Data format {#usage-format}

By default following operations are made when diagram drawing is embedded into documentation:

#. Diagram drawing is downoaded in **svg** format
#. If output format is other than HTML then data is converted locally with **rsvg** tool into one of the following:
  * **pdf** for PDF output
  * **png** for the rest

In some circumstances conversion with **rsvg** may have artifacts, and in this case data format can fix the problem.

Usualy it's better to set format for downoaded drawing, but not all renderers may support it, so
you may try to change local side conversion output format.

> NOTE: some rendering engines like **mermaid** or **pikchr** produce only **svg** and **rsvg** can't handle it right


### Renderer format {#usage-format-renderer}

Speicfy format for downloaded drawing. Even though it should produce better result than the case below,
not all rendering engines may support required format. See [diagram types](https://kroki.io/#support)

```
to_diagram(... , dformat='<format>')
```

Possible values for `<format>`:

* `png` - loseless image, can be used for most output documentation formats
* `jpeg` - lossy image, can be used for most output documentation formats
* `svg` - for HTML output only, but can be locally converted to **png**, **jpeg** or **pdf** after downloading
* `pdf` - for PDF output only


### Local conversion {#usage-format-conversion}

This kind of conversion is possible only in case if diagram drawings are rendered and downloaded in **svg** format.

````R
`r ''````{r <label>, dia='from_src', fig.ext='<format>'}
  to_diagram(...)
```
````

Possible values for `<format>`:

* `png` - loseless image, can be used for most output documentation formats
* `jpeg` - lossy image, can be used for most output documentation formats
* `pdf` - for PDF output only



## PDF production {#usage-pdf}

PDF document production most probably will require more attention.

Make sure you are satisfied with your latex class for PDF output, to avoid redundant work.

Then you'll want for sure to [limit hight](#usage-customize-rChunks-height) for large drawings,
but don't hurry to do this.

It's better to start with splitting the pages and setting necessary layout first.


### Page breaks {#usage-pdf-pageBreak}

Every chapter is started from new page.

For additional page breaks just add the following line into document:

```
\newpage
```


### Page orientation {#usage-pdf-pageOrientation}

Make sure following lines are included into your latex preamble part:

```
\usepackage{lscape}
\usepackage{pdfpages}
```

Then in documentation use following pattern:

````
`r ''````
Some text on a portrait page.

\newpage
\blandscape

Some text on a landscape page.

\newpage
\elandscape

Some other text on a portrait page.
```
````



## Full **to_diagram** function specification {#usage-spec}

Function **to_diagram** is defined in `docs_src/_fun.R` file which should be included
into `index.Rmd` file. More about this is [TODO: devdoc-swissknife anatomy](#anatomy).

This function renders diagram from textual description and inserts it into document.
Diagram is inserted with `knitr::include_graphics` function
or as [raw SVG](#usage-svg) code for HTML output (raw svg can be [turned off]((#usage-svg-file) via arguments).

Here is it's definition:

```R
to_diagram  <- function(
    data = "", src = "",
    dformat = "", rawsvg = TRUE,
    downloadOnly = FALSE, downloadName = "",
    service="Kroki", serviceUrl=NULL,
    engine=NULL,
    force=FALSE
    )
```

Arguments:

    data          - Diagram description in text form (should be compatible with
                    rendering engine).
                    Ignored if value for `src` is specified.
<!-- -->
    src           - Path to outer file with diagram description in text form.
                    See `docs_src/diagrams/README.md` for details.
                    Should be omitted if `data` argument is to be used.
<!-- -->
    dformat       - Specify data format for downloaded diagram.
                    See https://kroki.io/#support for details.
                    `svg` would be used by default if value is empty string.
                    Sometimes SVG conversion to PDF/PNG not works good on client
                    side (default). In that case it's suggested to use PNG or PDF.
                    Take a NOTE: not all Kroki services provide diagrams
                    in PNG / PDF format.
<!-- -->
    rawsvg        - Option to insert SVG as code right into HTML.
                    This way text on diagrams is searchable.
                    Enabled (TRUE) by default.
                    Set to FALSE to embed SVG as image.
                    Applicable only for HTML output and only if `dformat`
                    is "SVG" or empty string.
<!-- -->
    downloadName  - File name (part before extension) for local diagram's files.
<!-- -->
    downloadOnly  - Only generate and download diagram, don't insert into doc.
                    Use for custom diagram embedding later in the doc.
                    All the necessary format conversions will be completed.
                    Result would be in `docs_src/generated` dir.
                    If `downloadName` is specified then it would be used for
                    file name, otherwise label would be used if diagram is
                    specified via data, otherwise file name would be generated
                    from `src` path.
                    File extension would depend on `dformat` argument and on
                    `fig.ext` options for R chunk
<!-- -->
    service       - Rendering service (now it's sonly "Kroki")
<!-- -->
    serviceUrl    - Rendering service base url.
                    This is starting part of url for service access.
                    Default is path `http://kroki:8000` to local Kroki
                    instance that is started with `make_doc.sh`
<!-- -->
    engine        - Diagram rendering engine. Specify one of supported engines
                    (see Kroki for engines list)
                    Special value `from_src` for outer files SHOULD be used
                    to get engine from source file itself in case
                    if recommendations from `docs_src/diagrams/README.md`
                    are satisfied.
                    If omitted or NULL then value of R chunk option named `dia`
                    is treated as `engine`
<!-- -->
    force         - If FALSE(default) then existing downloaded diagram data
                    would be used. Set to TRUE to regenerate diagram from scratch
<!-- -->
