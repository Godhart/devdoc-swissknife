## Already rendered diagrams {#usage-rendered}

## Office files {#usage-office}

Office files could be used as source for diagrams

````R
`r ''````{r, libre-draw-singlepage, dia=""}
  to_diagram(src = "../diagrams/examples/libre-draw-singlepage.odg", service = "Office")
```

```{r, libre-draw-singlepage, dia=""}
  to_diagram(src = "../diagrams/examples/libre-draw-singlepage.odg", service = "Office")
```

This is intended for drawings in first order, but actualy this could be any document that can be opened by Libre Office.
