# Preface {-}

This is a demo project for development documentation generation with RMarkdown and Kroki!

This aproach allows you to create reproducable docs as PDF, gitbook and some other HTML formats including graphic
diagrams, totally described in markdown-based files (Pandoc flavor) with extra R chunks.

This project uses docker and docker-compose to build docs so it's ready to be integrated into your CI/CD flow.

There is few demonstrations in the project for general development usecases (which probably cover 95% of yor daily needs).
For more complicated usecases - checkout docs on links below.

Project structure, docs generation and some files are based on [Rmarkdowmn book](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book)

Diagrams code for most examples is borrowed straight from [Kroki!](https://kroki.io/examples.html)

This project is also can be used as template for your own documentation, see [this section](#as_template)

> To produce awsome PDFs you'll have to provide awsome Latex book class, since I don't have one and using Latex default
> for this project and current PDF version looks kinda ugly to me.
