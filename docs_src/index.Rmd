# Preface {-}

This is a demo project for development documentation generation with RMarkdown and Kroki!

This approach allows you to create reproducible docs as PDF, gitbook, and some other HTML formats including graphic
diagrams, totally described in markdown-based files (Pandoc flavor) with extra R chunks.

This way it's easy to version and merge graphic diagrams, get differences between versions, leave comments, review, etc.

Also most often it's faster to create and **edit** diagrams as text, do things like theming and refactoring themes.
Since the diagram's text description is more a model than just graphics, you don't have to track existing objects relations
when just placement is changed or objects added (until you rename objects) which makes your workflow less error-prone.

RMarkdown itself is a powerful and customizable tool, so you can fit docs to your needs. It would take efforts on start,
to make things neat but it would repay you in the end.

> To produce awesome PDFs you'll have to provide awsome Latex book class, since I don't have one and using Latex default
> for this project and current PDF version looks kinda ugly to me.

This project uses docker and docker-compose to build docs so it's ready to be integrated into your CI/CD flow.

There are few demonstrations in the project for general development use-cases (which probably cover 95% of your daily needs).
For more complicated use-cases - checkout docs on links below.

Project structure, docs generation and some files are based on [Rmarkdown book](https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown-book)

Diagrams code for most examples is borrowed straight from [Kroki!](https://kroki.io/examples.html)

This project is also can be used as template for your own documentation, see [this section](#as_template)
