Here is a Kroki service that can be launched for long time running.

When editing docs with live preview it's vital to have access to Kroki service
for generating diagrams.

If you don't want to use public service and don't have Kroki running in your
intranet then this one is for you.

This Kroki service would be available on address http://127.0.0.1:8081,
don't forget to setup editor's host environment properly (`SERVICE_KROKI`).

> Take a note that this one instance is not isolated from outer network.
